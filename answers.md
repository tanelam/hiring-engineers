# Setting up Environment

- First thing I did was to set up my environment. I used `Vagrant` and `VirtualBox` to complete this assignment. I decided to use `Vagrant` since it uses a much simpler architecture than Docker.

- Once the VirtualBox was up and running I used the command `vagrant ssh` to log into the to the newly started VirtualBox. Then, I sign up for Datadog to get access to my agent reporting metrics. An API key was provided to me in order to install Datadog Agent in my VirtualBox.

# Collecting metrics

### Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.
